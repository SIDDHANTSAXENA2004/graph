# Dijkstra's Algorithm in C

## Overview

This C program implements **Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm** for a directed or undirected weighted graph using an adjacency matrix. It calculates the shortest distance from a given starting node to all other nodes in the graph and displays the distance and paths.

## Features

- Accepts a custom number of vertices from the user.
- Reads the adjacency matrix (edge weights) from user input.
- Allows the user to set the starting node.
- Outputs the shortest distance and the shortest path from the starting node to every other node.

## How to Compile

```bash
gcc dijkstra.c -o dijkstra
```

## How to Run

```bash
./dijkstra
```
Or, in Windows:
```bat
dijkstra.exe
```

## Input Format

1. Number of vertices (n)
2. n Ã— n adjacency matrix; use 0 for no edge between i and j
3. Starting node (index starts from 0)

## Example Session

```
Enter no. of vertices: 4

Enter the adjacency matrix:
0 1 3 0
1 0 1 7
3 1 0 2
0 7 2 0

Enter the starting node: 0

Distance of node1=1
Path=1<-0
Distance of node2=2
Path=2<-1<-0
Distance of node3=4
Path=3<-2<-1<-0
```

## Example Adjacency Matrix

For the following graph (4 vertices):

|   | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 0 | 1 | 3 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 7 |
| 2 | 3 | 1 | 0 | 2 |
| 3 | 0 | 7 | 2 | 0 |

## Notes

- The program treats 0 as "no path" (except on the diagonal).
- Maximum allowed vertices: 10 (change `MAX` macro for larger graphs).
- Node indices start from 0.
- The shortest path and its total distance for every node (except the starting one) are displayed.
